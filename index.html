            <h3>Can I Sleep? 2021-04-05</h3>
            <p> <strong>Two days ago I wanted to sleep for the whole day</strong>. <span> After a challenging Winter quarter, I just wanted to sleep. I felt that the break was too short to regain any type of energy. I decided to go ahead and take a nap and push back some of the assignments that needed to be done. Although they were pushed back, it was not a problem at all as it is the beginning of the quarter and there is not much to do. These past two weeks of the Spring quarter I have just been sleeping most of the time.</span></p>
            <p><b>Fortunately, I was able to complete my list of assignments, which were:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Watch BILD 3 lecture</li>
                <li>Turn in HW #0 for CSE 101</li>
                <li>Go over practice problems for CSE 101</li>
                <li>Create plan for the following day</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>However, I did pushback somethings which were the lowlights of the day: </b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Getting somewhat behind</li>
                <li>Pushing back things makes me even more tired</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Here is the list in order that needs to be done:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li><em>Find a group for CSE 101</em></li>
                <li>Go to office hours for CSE 101</li>
                <li>Prepare for the upcoming CSE 101 quiz</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Ghost In My House? 2021-04-06</h3>
            <p><strong>Yesterday I was pretty much alone at my house</strong>. <span> I was finishing up some assignments for this Spring quarter. At around 9PM I heard some knocking in my living room. Didn't think of it too much. A few minutes go by and I hear it again. I thought there was someone outside, so I go out and take a look around the house. Nothing. I go back to my room and hear another sound. It sounded like someone was hitting one of the pictures on the wall with a coin.</span> <i> Dink, Dink, Dink</i>.</p>
            <p><b>This was one of the many things that has happened. Here is a list of my observations:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Coin hitting a picture</i></li>
                <li>Someone <i>dancing</i> on my desk at 3AM</li>
                <li>Something punching the couch right next to me (very rare)</li>
                <li>Weird whispers in my ear while I am sleeping telling me to avoid a trolley bridge by the 805</li>
                <li>Objects slowly moving seemingly to test my view</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>But there are some lowlights (I think):</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Probably a cat?</li>
                <li>Could be the wooden beams just being old </li>
                <li>Very small earthquakes</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Here is the list in order that I could do to identify this stuff:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Setup a camera in the living room</li>
                <li>Edit it to skip to the good parts</li>
                <li><em>Analyze to investigate</em></li>
            </ol>
            <details>

            <h3>When will School End? 2021-04-07</h3>
            <p><strong>Today I want to reflect on my academic experiences</strong>. <span>I have been in school for a long time. I just want to get my bachelors and get out. I am so close, too. I spent four years at a community college due to frequent major changes. Each year there felt like a lost year. I feel great being at UCSD and I am doing well so far. However, I hope I can get closure some day and move on into the real world doing things I want.</span></p>
            <p><b>Here are some things that I have accomplished:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Find a major that I can see myself doing</li>
                <li>Keep in touch with some professors</li>
                <li>Get into UCSD</li>
                <li>Get a 4.0 in at least one of the quarters</li>
                <li>Feel that I am making progress</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>But there are some lowlights where I have not accomplished:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Build a strong resume</em></li>
                <li>Build a network of people</li>
                <li>Build a personal brand</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Here is the list in order that I could do to accomplish the previous list:</b></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Attend a resume workshop</li>
                <li>Talk to professors about industry</li>
                <li><em>Look at successful people and their branding</em></li>
